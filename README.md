I'm **Kimonae**, a 'geek'

There few infos avout myself:
        
- 🔭 I’m currently working with Java, HTML, CSS, Bash, PHP, and JavaScript. Sometimes C++ / C#
- ☂ I also use Symfony, Angular, and Spring, and I apply Agile methodology
- 💬 Ask me about a project, a game, or computer science in general
- 📫 How to reach me: cake is fine. Feed me xD
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I was young, I thought I loved zucchini because I loved the pickle in my McDonald's burger. I used to say “I want it!” — but when my mother cooked zucchini for me, I didn’t like it. I thought my mother was a bad cook..
- ❄ Otherwise I'm a sysadmin.
