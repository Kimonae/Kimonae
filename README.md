### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Kimonae/Kimonae** is a boy ! REALLY !
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 💬 Ask me about a project, a game or just in computer science.
- 📫 How to reach me: With a cake it's okay. Give me food xD
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I was young I thought I loved zucchini because I loved the pickle in my burger mcdonald's ... I said "I want them" and when we i had, cooked by my mother, I don't liked them. I thinked my mother was a bad cook.
