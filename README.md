Here are some informations from myself:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Java, html, css, bash, php / javascript. Sometimes c++ / c#
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a project, a game or just in computer science.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was young I thought I loved zucchini because I loved the pickle in my burger mcdonald's ... I said "I want them" and when we i had, cooked by my mother, I don't liked them. I thinked my mother was a bad cook.
